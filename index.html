    <h1>Can Quantum Entanglement prove the Theory of Relativity Wrong??</h1>
    <small>16 August 2021</small><div style="padding:3rem"></div>
    <div class="bg"><p class="container container-center"> Physics is still struggling to have a unified theory which defines the properties of everything from fermions and bosons (subatomic particles) to solar systems and galaxies. Relativity has a good hand over macro objects while Quantum Mechanics rules over the subatomic world but both clash with each other many times.
        While no scientist till date is able to prove wrong the principles over which the theory of relativity is based. But everyone knows at heart that this is not the perfect theory as it does not work everywhere. And luckily we have some spooky theories in Quantum Mechanics that can help us prove Relativity wrong or at least help us in discovering the fact that we can travel faster than the speed of light.
        <br><br>
        One such theory is that of Quantum Entanglement which has gained a lot of buzz over the past years.
        <br><br>
        Now what is Quantum Entanglement? It basically means that the properties of two or more entangled particles cannot be measured independently of each other. That means that if you measure the quantum state of one particle you can know the quantum state of the second particle without even measuring it no matter how far those particles are (even light years away).
        <br>
        For instance we take two entangled particles with opposite spins light years away from each other and measure spin of one particle at an instant then we know the spin of the other particle too at that very instant. This implies that the particles can exchange information faster than the speed of light. Cool, this proves that information can travel faster than the speed of light (but how much faster??) between those particles.
        But how can we use this to communicate information in real world faster than the speed of light.
        Here is my thought experiment.
        <br><br>
        Suppose we take two pairs of Entangled particles with opposite spins Q1, Q2 and R1, R2 and take Q2 and R2 light years away from Q1 and R1. We know the spins of Q1 and Q2 and find out the spins of R1 and R2 relative to Q1 and Q2.
        <br><br>
        There can be two possible values -: Spin up â€“ which means â€˜YESâ€™
                                            Spin down-which means â€˜NOâ€™
        Now, we measure the spins of R1 and R2 relative to Q1, Q2 respectively (in one direction only). If we get a Spin Up on one side we get the same result on the other side light years away and vice versa. Now we reverse the spin of Q1 which automatically reverses the spin of Q2 and then measure the relative spins of R1 and R2 which will definitely come opposite to the previous result which was Spin Up on our case. 
        <br><br>
        So we sent a â€˜NOâ€™ to the other side faster than the speed of light!! Yay!!
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        We can now just reverse the spin of Q1 to send A â€˜YESâ€™ and reverse it again to send a â€˜NOâ€™.
        Likewise we can use 1 and 0 instead to send numbers.
        <br><br>
        I hope someone performs my experiment in future!! (if it is correct ðŸ˜‹)
